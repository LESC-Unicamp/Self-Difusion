# Self-diffusion coefficients for confined fluids in a slit pore 
<p align="justify">
This algorithm was originally designed to calculate the self-diffusion coefficient of the components of a confined system in tree dimensions from data obtained by a Molecular Dynamics Simulation with GROMACS for a alit pore. In this work, x and y will be called the parallel directions and z is the perpenticular direction, since the wall of the system is in the z axis. The self-diffusion coefficients for the parallel components are calculated based on the work developed by Liu and collaborators (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jp0375057">Liu et al., <b>J. Phys. Chem. B</b>, 108, 21, 6595–6602, 2004</a>). The perpendicular self-diffusion coefficient calculation, however, is based on the work developed by Franco and collaborators (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00653">Franco et al., <b> J. Chem. Theory Comput.</b>, 12, 11, 5247–5255, 2016</a>).

## Language
<p align="justify">
The main program, subroutines and functions contain some explanatory comments and are mainly written in C language. 
</p>

## Building and Compilation
<p align="justify">

  For compilation, we have used the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). We tested the algorithm using some GCC versions: 9.3.0 in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and 7.5.0 in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
</p>

We have built the code for the calculation of the self-difusion coefficients using the following command line:
</p>

```console
gcc diff.c -o out -lm
```
</p>

## Reporting Errors
<p align="justify">
If you spot an error in the program files and all other documentation, please submit an issue report using the <a href="https://github.com/LESC-Unicamp/Self-diffusion-coefficients-for-confined-fluids-in-a-slit-pore-/issues">Issues</a> tab.
</p>

## Input files preparation
<p align="justify">
Before running the code to obtain the coefficients, the user should first prepare the files obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. The program used for MD simulations was GROMACS (version 2018.03 tested). Multiple files are obtained as outputs in the simulation. Here, the files will be referred by "name.type".
</p>
First, it is necessary to obtain the mean density of the molecules in function of the distance in z. This was done using GROMACS and the files .trr and .tpr, as shown by the following command line:
</p>

```console
gmx density -f prod_out.trr -s prod_out.tpr -o density.xvg -sl 1000 -d z

```
For further details on how to use gmx density the user is referred to the GROMACS <a href="https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2018/onlinehelp/gmx-density.html">documentation</a> for the topic.
</p>
Next, the trajectory in function of the time step for each molecule must be obtained. Once again using GROMACS and files .trr and .tpr, as shown by the following command line:
</p>
  
```console
gmx trjconv -f prod_out.trr -s prod_out.tpr -pbc nojump -o out.gro

```
For further details on how to use gmx trjconv the user is referred to the GROMACS <a href="https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2018/onlinehelp/gmx-trjconv.html">documentation</a> for the topic.
</p>
In both cases, the molecule of interest to obtain the self-diffusion coefficient must be carefully specified. Only one type of molecule can be studied at a time. 
</p>
In order to obtain a compact file from the trajectories of the center of mass of the molecules, an additional code is needed: cmass.c. We have built the code using the following command line:
</p>

```console
gcc cmass.c -o out -lm
```
To run the code, the command line used was:

```console
./out 2 out.gro cmass.dat 5000000 100
```
Where the first argument refers to the number of pseudoatoms used to built the molecule. In the case of methane, using <a href="http://trappe.oit.umn.edu/">TraPPE forcefield</a>, for example, this number equals to one, while for ethane is two. The second argument, refers to the output of gmx trjconv while the third argument is the output of cmass.c. 
</p>
Special attention must be taken to the last arguments, as they refer to the inputs of the .mdp file in the simulation. The fourth argument is the number os steps of the simulation (nsteps in the .mdp file) and the fifth refers to the interval between the recorded positions in the simulation (nstxout in the .mdp file).

Moreover, a folder named "results" should also be created inside the folder that the programs are running, as shown by the command line:
```console
mkdir results
```
Attention: this code is not suitable for molecules with pseudoatoms of different mass.

An executable file with all the commands is also available: doit_diff.exe.
</p>

## Running the Code
<p align="justify">
As the code calculates the diffusion coefficient of molecules in confined fluids, the coefficients have a dependency of the position in z. Therefore, special care must be taken to chose the interval for calculation according to the density profile. It is only possible to calculate the coefficient for small layers inside the pore.

![SC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98060271/150573653-6eead4ac-9bbb-40dd-a763-3719de5496c1.jpg)
</p>

In this code, two major regions are analyzed. One in the center of the pore and the other one closer to the wall. 

To run the code for example for the center of the pore, the command line used was:
```console
./out cmass.dat 2.50 3.50 2.50 3.50 density.xvg 10 50
```
Where the first argument is the output of the cmass.c code. The second and third arguments refer to the minimum and maximum positions considered for the parallel coefficients calculation while the forth and fifth refer to the perpendicular coefficient. The last ones are related to the interval chosen for the linear regression function needed for the parallel coefficients calculation.  

Attention: for the perpendicular coefficient calculation a linear region of the density profile must be chosen. 

It is also important to make sure that the value for "slab" in the code is the same used in the gmx density.  Another important point is to make sure the same values for the simulations are used both for cmass.c and diff.c, refering to:  "totsteps" - number os steps of the simulation (nsteps in the .mdp file) and "interval" - interval between the recorded positions in the simulation (nstxout in the .mdp file).

  <b>Parallel coefficients</b>
  
When running the code, the first step is read the cmass.dat file and create a matriz where each line is time step of the simulation and each colunm refers to one of the molecules position in that time. 

Next, the parallel self-coefficient calculation start, using the method developed by Liu and collaborators (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jp0375057">Liu et al., <b>J. Phys. Chem. B</b>, 108, 21, 6595–6602, 2004</a>). The first step is to calculate the Mean Square Displacemet (MSD) of the system <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jp0375057">- Equation 14</a>. In order to improve the statistics of the method, multiple time origins are used and then, the avarege of the results is obtained. 

The MSD for each time origin is obtained by tagging a particle for as long as it remains in the interval of positions definied in the command line to run the code. The displacement between two time steps are calculated and averaged for the amount of time under study. The variable "tlim" represents the amount of time steps that are analyzed for every loop of different time origin. In this scenario the time origins varies from 0 to steps-tlim. 

Tagging the particles is also important to caluculate the survival probability P(t) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jp0375057">- Equation 15</a>. The survival probability refers to the ratio between the amount of molecules that are initally in a layer, and the ones ramainin after a period of time. Naturally the values starts at one and finishes at zero. In other to best use the code, analyse and chose a tlim value to make sure the survival probability reaches zero.

The parallel coefficients can then be obtained by a linear regression from a graphic of the MSD over the P(t) in function of time <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jp0375057">- Equation 16</a>. Naturally, a linear region of the data must be chosen and the minimum e maximum values are inputs in the command line for running the code. 

The files generated in the parallel coefficients calculation are: 
  - msd.dat: data for the mean square displacement as a function of time ;
  - sprob_par.dat: data for the survival probability as a function of time;
  - msd_over_sprob.dat: data for the ratio of the MSD over the survival probability as a function of time.
</p>

<b>Perpendicular coefficient</b>

In order to obtain the diffusion perpendicular coefficient the method develop by Franco and collaborators (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00653">Franco et al., <b> J. Chem. Theory Comput.</b>, 12, 11, 5247–5255, 2016</a>) is used. The steps also start with the calculation of the MSD and the survival probability with multiple time origins. Next, there is the calculation of the residence time (tau), the integral of the survival probability, that is made by a trapezoidal numerical integration <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00653">- Equation 40</a>. Then, the natural logaritm of the density is obtained as a result of the development made considering a linear potential of mean force. A linear regression is made with the logaritm of the density and the position. After that, the constant alpha must be obtained <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00653">- Equation 27</a>. 

The perpendicular coefficient can then be obtained from the lenght of the layer (L), the residence time (tau) and alpha from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00653"> Equation 26</a> . The files generated are: 
  - sprob_perp.dat: data for the survival probability as a function of time;
  - lndensity.xvg: data for the natural logaritm of the density in function of position;
  - alpha.dat: value for constant alpha;
  - diff_confined.dat: values for the self-diffusion coefficient in the order Dxx, Dyy and Dzz.
</p>

## Alternative code 1 - Tolerance time
<p align="justify">
  An alternative code considers the addition of a tolerance time for the calculation of the self-diffusion coefficients in parallel and perpendicular directions. The addition of a tolerance time is done by considering the possibility that the molecule return to the layer after a short period of time, implying that the displacement was reasonably small and is a modification in the methods previusly used (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jp0375057">Liu et al., <b>J. Phys. Chem. B</b>, 108, 21, 6595–6602, 2004</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00653">Franco et al., <b> J. Chem. Theory Comput.</b>, 12, 11, 5247–5255, 2016</a>). The periods of time of tolerance (dt) are a multiple of the time step of the simulation. This value is also an input of this code.

 We have built this alternative code using the following command line:
```console
gcc diff_timetolerance.c -o out -lm
```  
 To run the code for example for the center of the pore and dt = 1, the command line used was:
```console
./out cmass.dat 2.50 3.50 2.50 3.50 density.xvg 10 50 1
```
 Where the first argument is the output of the cmass.c code. The second and third arguments refer to the minimum and maximum values considered for the parallel coefficients calculation while the forth and fifth refer to the perpendicular coefficient. The two next ones are related to the interval chosen for the linear regression function. The last one is the tolerance time added. The files genereted are the same of the original code.  

</p>
  
## Alternative code 2 - Discretization of the Smoluchowski Equation
<p align="justify">
 
  Another alternative code for the calculation of the self-diffusion coefficent in the perpendicular direction is presented using the discretization of the Smoluchowski Equation <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00653">- Equation 67</a>. 
  
  <b>Attention</b>: it is need to run the code diff.c before using this alternative code in order to have a reference for the survival probability. 
  
  We have built this alternative code using the following command line:  
```console
gcc diff_smo.c -o out -lm
```  
  To run the code for example, to particles close to the wall, the command line used was:
```console
./out sprob_perp.dat 1.34 1.448 density.xvg 
```
  Where the fist argument refers to the name of the output file for survival probability of the diff.c code. The second and third elements refers to the interval in position considered for the calculation and the last argument is the name of the density file.
  
  When running the code, the first step is read the survival probability of the diff.c code and the density file. Next, the boundary and initial conditions are set. The value of the time step of the discretization resolution (dt) should be ajusted if there is no stability in the results. 
  
  The resolution of the Smoluchowski equation is done by minimizing the square difference between the value calculated for the probability function and the one provided by the diff.c code adjusting the value of D - the self-diffusion coefficient. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197616000385?casa_token=DdxwqB7h6mkAAAAA:i9JRCaZY2b-c09vc4UmOIZ7IWkQBsMSYWV6h5-np_Z225AG5poIOt7dbsa4oRUDB2UgnOYRzaw">golden search algoritm</a> is used for this minimization. In adition, there is the need to equalize the number of points for the survival probability between the methods. Due to the smaller time step need to obtain stability, resulting in more points, the Smoluchowski discretization results have to be averaged. The survival probability from the Smoluchwski discretization is obtained by the numerical integration in time of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00653"> Equation 67</a>.  
  
  The files generated are: 
  - sprob_perp_smo.dat: data for the survival probability as a function of time for Smoluchowiski discretization;
  - sprob_perp_ps.dat: data for the survival probability as a function of time in ps for the method of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00653">- Franco et al.</a>;
  - diff_smo.dat: values for the self-diffusion coefficient Dzz for Smoluchowiski discretization.
  
  <b>NOTE:</b> In order to proper run this code, the user must have at least 12 G of RAM available.
